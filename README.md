# 2023-NSERC-Solid-Electrolyte-Code-ST

this code was created for the Summer 2023 NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards by Sophia Thompson, 
as supervised by Professor Iain Moyles and PHD student Laura Keane. 
It executes a recreation of the solid electrolyte model developed by Keane and Moyles in their paper, 
An Asymptotic Analysis of Space Charge Layers in a Mathematical Model of a Solid Electrolyte.
